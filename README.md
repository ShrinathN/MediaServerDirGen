# MediaServerDirGen

## What is this?
A set of scripts to convert any normal media library, say your precious movies or music collection that lives on your external USB harddrive into an HTTP server ready format.
Think Kodi, but for the browser.

## How does it do that?
* It indexes every single media file in the directories you give it, and all of their subdirectories and creates nice HTML pages all with nice video tags for audio and video and images for, of course, images.

## What else?
* This is so that any normal HTTP server can host your media library and it can be accessible from any device on your network or even outside if you configure everything correctly.
* Directory listing is similar but do you REALLY not want a specialized software for EVERYTHING?

## Future plans
* Custom CSS support
* Basic features like media randomization, photoframe mode, etc
* Cover art, lyrics fetching for music
* Plot description, rating, synopsis, cover art fetching for movies, TV shows, and anime
* Visual configuration
